                <ol>
                    <li>Put the goat meat in a medium pot.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the dried fish and add it to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 onion, salt to taste and 2 maggi cubes.</li>
                    <li>CAdd 3 cups water and bring to a boil on high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 min.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, put the chile peppers and the remaining onion in a blender and puree.</li>
                    <li>Scrape the onion pepper mixture into a bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Put the shrimp, crayfish and melon seed in a clean blender and blend until a powder forms.</li>
                    <li>Put it in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Squeeze the excess liquid from the spinach and set aside.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, check the meat.</li>
                    <li>If it is still tough, add more water to the pot so that cooking liquid covers the meat.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook until the goat is fork tender, add the onion pepper mixture and cook 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to medium and add the melon seed mixture.</li>
                    <li>Cook 30 minutes longer and add the spinach, the oils and the 2 remaining maggi cubes.
                    <li>Cover it and cook for another 15 minutes.</li>   
                    <li>Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil on high heat.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat to medium and stir in the pounded yam flour.</li>
                    <li>Keep stirring until it is smooth and soft. If it is really thick, add some hot water. It will have a similar texture to polenta. </li>
                    <li>Serve the pounded yam on plates and serve with bowls of egusi soup.
